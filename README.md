# CryptoClustering
Module 19 Crypto clustering
### Analysis steps
* Load and preprocess the data.
* Scale the data using StandardScaler.
* Find the best value for k using the elbow method.
* Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the original scaled data.
* optimize clusters with PCA to reduce the features to three principal components.
* Find the best value for k using the PCA data.
* Cluster cryptocurrencies with K-means using the PCA data.
* Visualize and compare the results using hvPlot.
  ### conclusion
  Overall, this analysis shows how PCA can help simplify and visualize the clustering of cryptocurrencies, providing insights into how different coins relate to each other in a reduced-dimensional space.
